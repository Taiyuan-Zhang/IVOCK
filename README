you have to have intel TBB installed to compile the code.

this method now is not fully stable, a more stable version that preserves circulation(in a 
discrete sense) is on the way.  The code now has a bad memory implementation, which should be
re-implemented later.

once compiled, run
xx.exe file_path advection_scheme VC_value



compile the particle renderer to render the simulation result. 
once compiled, one renders the data by:
Particle_renderer.exe  [path(the folder where Particle data stores, no space in name)] 
particle_radius density_scale opacity light_x light_y light_z frame_start frame_end
